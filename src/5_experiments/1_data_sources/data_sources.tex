Obviously, training and evaluation of a knowledge graph completion model require a knowledge graph. In case of the Power model, there is also the need for textual entity descriptions. The graphs chosen for this work are the popular FB15K-237~\cite{Toutanova2015ObservedVL} subset of the  Freebase~\cite{Bollacker2008FreebaseAC} graph and the CoDEx~\cite{Safavi2020CoDExAC} graph, a knowledge graph constructed with the aim of providing a further improved benchmark for knowledge graph completion. The graphs' fact splits into training, validation and test subsets, together with matching texts, are provided by Felix Hamann as part of his work on inductive reasoning with Text (IRT), an approach to create open-world evaluation benchmarks from given knowledge graphs~\cite{}. The following Subsections~\ref{subsec:5_experiments/1_data_sources/1_knowledge_graphs} and~\ref{subsec:5_experiments/1_data_sources/2_text_sets} give an impression of the size of the knowledge graphs, the shape of the fact splits and the kind of texts in the text sets.
