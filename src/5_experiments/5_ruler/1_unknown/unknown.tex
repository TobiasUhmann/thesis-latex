could evaluate against unknown valid facts, close to use case, or could eval against all valid facts as usual []
ok to validate against known + unknown facts because known not seen during training
eval against unknown means filter out predicted known facts
table ? shows comparison between both eval methods
when evaluating against known + unknown, best result for 100
when evaluating against unknwon, best result for 50 as balance between known and remaining for prediction. 0 = open world = no preds, 100 = no left for prediction
