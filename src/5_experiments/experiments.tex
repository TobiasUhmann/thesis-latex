\autoref{ch:4_approach} has presented the Power model consisting of the Texter, Ruler, and Aggregator components. This chapter presents the evaluation results and experiments performed on data originating from two knowledge graphs and various text sources. \autoref{sec:5_experiments/1_data_sources} introduces the considered knowledge graphs and text sources, followed by \autoref{sec:5_experiments/2_power_splits} that presents the \emph{Power datasets} created from those, which in turn were used to train and evaluate different versions of the Texter, Ruler, and Aggregator. In \autoref{sec:5_experiments/3_texter}, experiments show that encoding texts using static word embeddings leads to almost as good results as using transformers and that the attention mechanism does create a comprehensible prioritization between the texts, although it does not improve performance. Next, \autoref{sec:5_experiments/4_ruler} demonstrates that already few known facts about an entity suffice for reasonable rule-based predictions before \autoref{sec:5_experiments/5_aggregator} concludes with the Power model's overall evaluation results that prove that combining the Texter's and the Ruler's predictions in the Aggregator leads to a higher mean average precision.
