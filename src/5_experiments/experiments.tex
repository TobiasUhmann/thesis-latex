Chapter~\ref{ch:4_approach} has presented the final Power model that resulted from a series of experiments conducted on the model's Texter, Ruler and Aggregator components. This chapter presents some of those experiments and presents the evaluation results of both, the experiments' and the final model's results. Thereby the evaluation was performed on data originating from the knowledge graphs and text sets presented in Section~\ref{sec:5_experiments/1_base_datasets} that were used as a basis for the \emph{Power datasets} presented in~\ref{sec:5_experiments/2_power_datasets}. The Power datasets in turn were used to train and evaluate Texter, Ruler and Aggregator as shown in sections~\ref{sec:5_experiments/4_texter}~--~\ref{sec:5_experiments/6_aggregator}.
