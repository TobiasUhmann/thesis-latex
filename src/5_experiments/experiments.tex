Chapter~\ref{ch:4_approach} has presented the final Power model that resulted from a series of experiments conducted on the model's Texter, Ruler and Aggregator components. This chapter explains and evaluates those experiments and compares the results to the final model. Section~\ref{sec:5_experiments/1_base_datasets} introduces the basic knowledge graphs and text sets that form the base for the \emph{Power datasets} presented in~\ref{sec:5_experiments/2_power_datasets}, which are then used to train and evaluate Power's Texter, Ruler and Aggregator components as shown in sections~\ref{sec:5_experiments/4_texter},~\ref{sec:5_experiments/5_ruler} and~\ref{sec:5_experiments/6_aggregator}.
In particular section~\ref{sec:5_experiments/4_texter} discusses various variations of the model that are divided into experiments with static and contextual word embeddings, the latter of which are used in the final Power model. The Texter and Ruler components are evaluated individually and, finally, as part of the Power as a whole.
