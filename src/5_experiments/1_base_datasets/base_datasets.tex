Fundamentally, a knowledge graph and textual entity descriptions are required that the Power model can be trained and used upon. The graphs chosen for this work are the FB15K-237~\cite{Toutanova2015ObservedVL} subset of the popular Freebase~\cite{Bollacker2008FreebaseAC} graph and the CoDEx~\cite{Safavi2020CoDExAC} graph, a knowledge graph constructed with the aim of providing an improved benchmark for knowledge graph completion. For both graphs, the IRT datasets created by Hammann~\cite{}, which split the graph facts into training, validation and test sets and provide entity contexts, are used. The following sub sections give an overview of the graphs' dimensions and list some example texts.
