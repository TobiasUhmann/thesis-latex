Concerning the Ruler's training, the number of mined rules should play the decisive role over the success in inference. With increasing searching, new rules should be mined steadily in the graph up to a certain point. The expectation was that at the beginning most rules should be found per time interval and that the rate at which new rules are added should flatten over time until the information from the graph structure is exhausted. However, it was also assumed that the number of useful rules with $conf_{min} > 0.5$ would be exhausted earlier and that only rules with lower confidence would be found thereafter. Until then, recall was expected to grow quickly. How the quality of the rules would change during the finding process was not certain. It was assumed that rules with high support would be found at the beginning, so that the support of new rules would decrease in the course of mining. Regarding the confidence, there was no clear expectation. Overall, it was assumed that the changing quality during the finding process should have a negligible effect compared to the increasing recall and that F1 and mAP should therefore increase continuously. A decrease in F1 and mAP was excluded because rules with $conf_{min} > 0.5$ should generally have a positive effect. Table~\ref{tab:5_experiments/4_ruler/2_rule_count/results} shows the emprical results.

\end{table}

Surprisingly, not only the number of totally mined rules increased linearly with time, but also the number of useful rules with $conf_{min} > 0.5$. The unbroken trend suggests that both the CDE and FB graphs still offer much room upwards for more rules. Nonetheless, most of the later mined seem to predict facts that are already predicted by earlier mined rules. At least, that is what the recall values suggest start converging after a mining time $t = 1000s$, although mining might still be continued for some time on the FB split. The F1 and mAP scores, however, approach their peak values already after $t = 300s$, because precision decreases and counteracts the increasing recall. The precision decrease speaks for the hypothese of decreasing rule quality over time. The influence of rule support and confidence is thereby further studied in the following section~\ref{subsec:5_experiments/4_ruler/2_rule_count}. As final test results for the Ruler the top values after mining time $t = 1000s$ were chosen. The version after $t = 100s$ used for the other experiments differs only by a few percentage points in F1 and mAP.
