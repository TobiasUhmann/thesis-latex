keeping choices from stat experiments only remaining variation is optimizer
use more sophisticated optimizer for bert because complex architecture causes several issues like vanishing gradient due to many layers
<explain AdamW>
table \ref{tab:5_experiments/4_texter/3_context/3_optimizer/grid_search} shows results for optimizers used before, but results so bad that cut, in addition to AdamW over multiple learning rates

AdamW much better
