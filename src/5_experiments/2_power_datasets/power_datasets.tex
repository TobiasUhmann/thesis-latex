Theoretically an IRT fact split and matching text set are sufficient for training the Power model. However, when evaluat However, when evaluating the trained model against the IRT split's open-world entities, Power would perform only mediocre as it could only use its Texter component for inference, since the open-world entities do not provide any facts the Ruler can work with. Therefore, considering the intended few-shot scenario, the IRT splits are transformed to \emph{Power splits}, that involve some known facts for the test entities, by dividing the IRT split's open-world facts into so-called \emph{known facts}, that are allowed to be used for rule application during inference, and \emph{unknown facts}, that stay unknown. Meanwhile, the close-world entities' training and validation facts are merged as there is no need for the latter. Figure~\ref{fig:5_experiments/2_power_datasets/splits} illustrates the repartitioning.

The percentage of known and unknown facts can be varied when creating the Power split to study the Ruler's effectiveness on entities with more or less given knowledge. Table~\ref{tab:5_experiments/2_power_datasets/power_splits} lists the splits used for the evaluation. In practice, few-shot splits are particularly interesting. Since there are only about 20 facts per entity on average, the fact splits with 5\% and 15\% known facts can be considered few-shot scenarios. The splits with 0\% known facts correspond to an zero-shot open-world scenario. For readability, the Power splits based on the CoDEx-M and FB15k-237 splits are abbreviate to "CDE" and "FB".
