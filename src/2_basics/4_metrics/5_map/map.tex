precision, recall, f1 do not consider order of predictions
power yields probabilities for facts, makes sense to rank probable facts higher
like google search

\[
    AP@n = \frac{1}{GTP} \sum_{k=1}^{n} P@n \cdot rel@n
\]

then, mean over all entities = mean of all average precisions = mAP

\[
    mAP = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} AP_i
\]
