As described in the introduction in Chapter~\ref{ch:1_introduction}, the Power model is an ensemble model, consisting of a rule-based and a text-based component, whose goal is the comprehensible prediction of new facts. Given a query entity with a few known facts and descriptive texts, Power implements this requirement by providing prioritized lists of rules and sentences that were crucial for the predicted facts. Considering the application scenario in which a user uses the model for support of manual knowledge graph completion, it is also important that correct predictions are ranked as high as possible among an entity's predicted facts.

Technically, the Power ensemble consists of three components as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:4_approach/power_architecture}. Besides the rule-based component, named \emph{Ruler}, and the text-based component, named \emph{Texter}, it also contains the so-called \emph{Aggregator} that combines the Ruler's and Texter's predictions. If both Ruler and Texter predict a fact, the final prediction yielded by the Aggregator comes with both, the Ruler's prioritzed list of decisive rules and the Texter's ranked list of sentences, and is considered more reliable than a fact predicted by only one of the components.

Depending on the dataset at hand, either the Ruler or Texter might perform better. In general, the Texter should perform better for graphs that contain many similar facts, such as $(x, part~of, Asia)$ with $x \in \{China, India, Japan, \dots\}$, while the Ruler also works well on diverse datasets but cannot handle open-world entities about which no facts are known. Together, they complement each other: The Ruler handles very rare facts while the Texter can bootstrap the prediction process on open-world entities until the Ruler can join when some facts are available for rule application. In Chapter~\ref{sec:5_experiments/5_aggregator}, the Ruler's and Texter's evaluation results are compared to each other as well as to the results achieved by the Aggregator.
