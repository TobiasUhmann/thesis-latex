The Aggregator produces the POWER model's final predictions for an entity by merging the Ruler's and Texter's
predictions.
As part of the merge process, the combined prediction set is again sorted by confidence leading to a mix of the top
Ruler and Texter predictions as the most promising predictions.
If a fact is predicted by Ruler and Texter, the final prediction is assigned the higher confidence, and the prediction
will have the Ruler's ranked rules as well as the Texter's ranked sentences attached.

As expected, by combining the Ruler's and the Texter's predictions, recall improves.
Precision, on the other hand, decreases as correct facts predicted by both components are not counted twice during
evaluation while the Ruler's and Texter's false positives rarely overlap.
However, as the combined prediction sets are sorted by confidence, average precision increases as the best predictions
from both components fill the top slots as shown in chapter~\ref{ch:5_experiments}.
